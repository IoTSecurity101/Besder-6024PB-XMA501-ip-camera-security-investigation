# Prerequisite
For the final project of my Bachelor's studies I've chosen to investigate security vulnerabilities that can be found in IP Cameras. And for this reason I've bought Besder 6024PB-XMA501 IP Camera from AliExpress. During the investigation that I have done during writing my final project I've discovered some interesting things with the security of this camera and I've decided to go a little deeper and post a more troughout research here.
